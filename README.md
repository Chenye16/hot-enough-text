hot-enough-text
===============

Uses Tessel + Twilio to send a text notification when something is hot enough.

I regularly put water on the stove to boil, get distracted, and completely forget to check on it. This project closes the water-boiling loop by sending me a text message when the water is boiling.

This is also easily adaptable to other situations as wellâ€“ just change the threshold temperature and use it to know when you can put meat on the grill, [salmon in the smokehouse](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Smoke-Salmon/).

I use a thermocouple (not Tessel's climate module) because a thermocouple is versatile, can take high temperatures, and is fine to immerse in water. Tim wrote [a Node library for it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thermocouple-max31855), so it's not difficult to use one.
